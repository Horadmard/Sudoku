# The Sudoku game as AI Project using BackTrack Algorithm

To do:
- Use BackTrack Method
- Implant Tree and DFS(or smt better)
- The Sudoku table must be clarify as a matrix of matrices
- Algorithm Explanation
- Time Complexity?
- Space Complexity?


Tips:
- Starting with low number blocks could accelerate the program
- Node of the tree must know thair childs
- The navigated path must be stored(in a stack)
- Maybe DFS isn't the last answer(Think about other navigation methods)
- Do we have really need to Create all the tree? or just Create our navigating path
